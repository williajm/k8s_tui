# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

K8S-TUI is a fast, keyboard-driven terminal user interface for Kubernetes cluster management built with Go. It uses the Bubble Tea TUI framework for rendering and the official Kubernetes client-go library for cluster interaction.

## Build, Test, and Lint Commands

### Building
```bash
# Build the main binary
go build -o k8s-tui cmd/k8s-tui/main.go

# Build for specific platform
go build -v -o k8s-tui.exe ./cmd/k8s-tui  # Windows
go build -v -o k8s-tui ./cmd/k8s-tui     # Linux/macOS

# Run directly
go run cmd/k8s-tui/main.go
```

### Testing
```bash
# Run all tests
go test ./...

# Run with verbose output
go test -v ./...

# Run with coverage report
go test -coverprofile=coverage.out ./...

## Architecture

### Application Structure

The codebase follows a clean architecture pattern:

- **cmd/k8s-tui/**: Application entry point using Cobra for CLI handling
- **internal/app/**: Core Bubble Tea application model (Model-Update-View pattern)
- **internal/k8s/**: Kubernetes client wrapper with connection management
- **internal/models/**: Data models for resources (PodInfo, ServiceInfo, DeploymentInfo, StatefulSetInfo)
- **internal/ui/**: UI layer separated into:
  - **components/**: Reusable UI components (Header, Footer, ResourceList, Tabs, Selector, DetailView, LogViewer, DescribeViewer, ContainerSelector)
  - **keys/**: Keyboard bindings
  - **styles/**: Lipgloss theme and styling

### Bubble Tea Architecture

The app uses the Elm Architecture (TEA) pattern:

1. **Model** (`app.Model`): Holds application state including:
   - UI components (header, footer, tabs, resourceList, detailView, namespaceSelector)
   - View state (viewMode, searchMode, loading, connected)
   - Kubernetes client and current namespace/context

2. **Update** (`app.Update`): Processes messages and returns new model + commands:
   - Routes to specialized handlers: `handleKeyPress`, `handleNamespaceSelector`, `handleSearchMode`
   - Handles resource loading messages per resource type
   - Processes watch events for real-time updates (with fallback to 5-second polling)

3. **View** (`app.View`): Renders the current state:
   - Switches between list view and detail view based on `viewMode`
   - Overlays namespace selector when visible
   - Shows help screen or error messages as needed

**Key Message types**:
- `resourcesLoadedMsg`: Contains loaded resources for a specific ResourceType (pods, services, deployments, statefulsets)
- `watchEventMsg`: Watch API event (ADDED, MODIFIED, DELETED) for real-time updates
- `watchErrorMsg`: Watch connection errors and reconnection notifications
- `connectionStateMsg`: Connection state changes (Connected, Reconnecting, Disconnected, Error)
- `namespacesLoadedMsg`: List of available namespaces for selector
- `tickMsg`: Timer for fallback polling mode (5-second interval when watch unavailable)
- `tea.KeyMsg`: Keyboard input
- `tea.WindowSizeMsg`: Terminal resize events

### ViewMode State Management

The app has two primary view modes:
- **ViewModeList**: Shows the resource list (default view)
- **ViewModeDetail**: Shows detailed information for the selected resource

Pressing Enter switches to detail view, Esc/Back returns to list view. View mode resets when switching tabs.

### Kubernetes Client Pattern

The `k8s.Client` wraps `kubernetes.Clientset` and provides:
- Kubeconfig loading priority: in-cluster → KUBECONFIG env → ~/.kube/config
- Context and namespace management (mutable via SetNamespace)
- Connection testing with timeout
- Resource fetching methods for multiple resource types:
  - Pods: `GetPods`, `GetAllPods`, `GetPod`, `GetPodLogs`, `StreamPodLogs`, `WatchPods`
  - Services: `GetServices`, `GetAllServices`, `GetService`, `WatchServices`
  - Deployments: `GetDeployments`, `GetAllDeployments`, `GetDeployment`, `WatchDeployments`
  - StatefulSets: `GetStatefulSets`, `GetAllStatefulSets`, `GetStatefulSet`, `WatchStatefulSets`
  - Events: `GetEvents`, `GetAllEvents`, `GetEventsForResource`, `WatchEvents`
  - Describe: `DescribePod`, `DescribeService`, `DescribeDeployment`, `DescribeStatefulSet`
  - Namespaces: `GetNamespaces`
- Watch API infrastructure:
  - `WatchManager`: Orchestrates multiple resource watchers
  - `ResourceWatcher`: Manages watch streams for individual resource types
  - `ExponentialBackoff`: Reconnection strategy with jitter

### Resource Models

Each resource type has a corresponding `*Info` model in `internal/models/`:
- **PodInfo**: Includes containers array, ready status, restart counts
- **ServiceInfo**: Includes type, ClusterIP, ExternalIP, ports, selectors
- **DeploymentInfo**: Includes replicas, ready, up-to-date, available counts
- **StatefulSetInfo**: Includes replicas, ready count, update strategy
- **EventInfo**: Includes type, reason, message, timestamp, involved object
- **LogEntry**: Includes timestamp, level, message with automatic log level detection

All resource models provide:
- `GetStatusSymbol()`: Returns visual indicator (✓, ✗, ○, ⚠, ⊗)
- `formatAge()`: Converts timestamp to human-readable age (e.g., "5m", "2h", "3d")

### UI Component Design

**ResourceList** (generic component):
- Maintains state for all resource types in separate slices
- Switches display mode via `ResourceType` enum (Pod, Service, Deployment, StatefulSet, Event)
- Handles navigation (up/down, page up/down, home/end)
- Supports search filtering
- Renders appropriate table columns per resource type
- Diff-based updates for watch events: `AddOrUpdatePod()`, `RemovePod()`, etc. for all resource types
- Preserves cursor position and selection during incremental updates

**Tabs**:
- Manages active tab selection (0=Pods, 1=Services, 2=Deployments, 3=StatefulSets, 4=Events)
- Provides `NextTab()` and `PrevTab()` for keyboard navigation
- Renders with active/inactive styling

**Selector** (namespace selector):
- Modal-style component for choosing from a list of options
- Shows/hides via `IsVisible()` state
- Supports up/down navigation within options
- Returns selected value via `GetSelected()`

**ContainerSelector**:
- Modal dialog for selecting containers in multi-container pods
- Shows init containers with differentiation
- Keyboard navigation (up/down/enter/esc)
- Returns selected container name

**DetailView**:
- Renders detailed information for selected resource
- Type-specific methods: `ViewPod()`, `ViewService()`, `ViewDeployment()`, `ViewStatefulSet()`
- Displays formatted key-value pairs using `styles.RenderDetailRow()`

**LogViewer**:
- Real-time log streaming with follow mode
- Search/filter within logs
- Timestamp toggle
- Log level detection and color coding
- Circular buffer (10,000 lines) for memory efficiency
- Previous container logs support

**DescribeViewer**:
- Multiple format support (Describe, YAML, JSON)
- Format switching with keyboard shortcuts (d/y/j)
- Structured describe output with sections
- Scrollable viewport for large resources

### Component Interaction Pattern

The main app model (`app.Model`) orchestrates all components:
1. Tabs component determines which `ResourceType` is active
2. ResourceList displays resources for the current type
3. WatchManager sends real-time updates via watch events (when enabled)
4. App processes watch events and calls ResourceList diff-based update methods
5. When Enter is pressed, app switches to `ViewModeDetail`
6. DetailView renders the selected resource from ResourceList
7. Namespace selector overlays everything when visible (triggered by 'n' key)

This pattern avoids tight coupling—components don't know about each other, only the main model coordinates them. Watch mode operates transparently; the UI receives updates via message passing regardless of whether they come from watch events or polling.

## Development Workflow

### Branch Strategy
- **main**: Protected branch requiring PR and passing CI
- **dev**: Experimental work branch for ongoing development
- **feature/*** or **hotfix/***: Feature branches for PRs

### Before Creating PR
```bash
# Always run these locally first
go test ./...
go fmt ./...
golangci-lint run --timeout=5m ./...
```

### CI Requirements
All PRs must pass:
- **Test**: Go 1.21, 1.22, 1.23 on Ubuntu, macOS, Windows with race detector
- **Lint**: golangci-lint with 5m timeout
- **Build**: Cross-platform build verification

The CI configuration uses:
- Test coverage reporting to Codecov (Ubuntu + Go 1.23 only)
- Artifact uploads for built binaries (7-day retention)
- Parallel matrix strategy for efficiency

### Commit Message Convention
Follow Conventional Commits format:
```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, chore, ci
Examples:
  feat(ui): Add pod log streaming view
  fix(k8s): Handle connection timeout gracefully
  test: Add unit tests for pod list component
```

## Linting Configuration

The project uses golangci-lint with specific settings:
- **Line length**: 140 characters
- **Function length**: 100 lines, 50 statements
- **Complexity**: Max cyclomatic complexity of 15
- **Import ordering**: Local prefix `github.com/williajm/k8s-tui`
- **Test exclusions**: funlen and dupl disabled for `_test.go` files

Key enabled linters: bodyclose, errcheck, gosec, gosimple, ineffassign, staticcheck, unused, revive

## Running the Application

```bash
# Use default kubeconfig
./k8s-tui

# Specify custom kubeconfig
./k8s-tui --kubeconfig ~/.kube/custom-config

# Start in specific namespace
./k8s-tui --namespace production
./k8s-tui -n production

# Use specific context
./k8s-tui --context staging-cluster
```
